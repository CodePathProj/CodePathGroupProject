## Overview
### Description
The app will give users two movies to pick which one they perfer. Depending on the user's choice we increase or decrease the rating of the movie.

### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Entertainment/Movie
- **Mobile:** This app would be primarily developed for mobile use but would perhaps later be developed for computer use. Functionality wouldnâ€™t be limited to mobile devices, however mobile version could potentially have more features.
- **Story:** Allows user to choose between different movies, and generate ranking of movies based on preferences.
- **Market:** Any individual who wants to look at movie ranking can use this app.
- **Habit:** This app can be used often or unoften depending on the user's life.
- **Scope:** First we can just have ranking of movies, but later on pair users depending on similarites of movies preferences.
